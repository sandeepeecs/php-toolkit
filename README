PHP Toolkit?
------------

PHP Toolkit is library of validators, helpers and other kind
of stuff that should help us in programming day-to-day job.

Reinventing the wheel is not needed :)

Requirements
------------

PHP Toolkit is mainly developed on PHP 5.3.x branch.

Running it on lower PHP version can cause some problems
but in that case just use the issue form [1] and it should
be fixed.

Wait. You are a programmer right?
Good news! That's mean that You can fork this repo and fix
it yourself. Just remember to give me a tip so I commit
your changes for others. Thanks in advance for this :)
